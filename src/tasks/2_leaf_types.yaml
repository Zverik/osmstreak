description: >-
  Mapping a tree is not just placing a ''natural=tree'' node. You have to specify its type.
  Please read wiki pages on [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leaf_type leaf_type]
  and [https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:leaf_cycle leaf_cycle], and then add 2 trees near your home or somewhere
  familiar to you using these tags.
test:
  created_2_nodes: ["natural=tree", "leaf_type=*", "leaf_cycle=*"]
