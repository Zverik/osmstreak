title: Add a Sidewalk
emoji: 🚶🏿
description: >-
  Sidewalk is a footway near a road. For a better pedestrian routing, find a road without a sidewalk mapped,
  and draw two footways on the both sides (backed by an imagery) with an additional ''footway=sidewalk'' tag.
  When adding a crossing as a way, use ''highway=footway + footway=crossing''.
test:
  created_2_ways: ["highway=footway", "footway=sidewalk"]
