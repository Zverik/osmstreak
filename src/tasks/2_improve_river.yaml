title: Improve a River
emoji: 📏
description: >-
  Most rivers have already been mapped. The issue is, that was done using a low-resolution
  satellite imagery. Now you can do better: fire up JOSM, select a river, press "W" and
  improve the way. Add at least 10 nodes to a ''waterway=river''.
test:
  modified_way: "waterway=river"
  added_10_nodes: ""
