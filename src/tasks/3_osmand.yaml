  [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand OsmAnd] is one of the popular
  OpenStreetMap applications for Android devices,
  highly configurable, but a bit too complex for some. It can upload points to the map.
  Install the "OSM Editing" plugin and create a point somewhere. Read
  [https://osmand.net/features/osm-editing-plugin the documentation] if you get lost
  in the interface.
