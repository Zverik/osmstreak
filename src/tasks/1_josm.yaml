title: Make an edit with JOSM
emoji: â˜•
description: >-
  Install the JOSM editor, if you haven't already, and edit something with it.
  We recommend drawing some buildings:
   
  Download a part of the map, add an imagery layer,
  press "A" and click on a corner of a building. Then double-click on an adjacent corner,
  making it a line. Then press "X" and drag the line out to make it a rectangle.
  Finally, press "Alt+A" to add ''building=yes'', and then upload the change.

test:
  changeset: "created_by=JOSM*"
