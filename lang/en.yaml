  about:
      what_is_this: What is this
      what_is_this_content: >-
        OSM Streak makes you do small tasks for OpenStreetMap every day. The goal is to
        map every day for at least a year. Tasks are small, five minutes each. The point
        is to map every day, not map as much as you can. Persistence pays off.
      points: Points
      points_content: >-
        For each submission you get points. At first you get one point, from the
        third day in a row you get two points for each task, and so on. If you keep
        mapping for a month in a row, you would get five points for a changeset.
      tasks: Tasks
      tasks_content1: >-
        You do not have to do exactly what the page tells you to. Any non-empty
        changeset will be accepted. But if you follow the task description, you will
        get an extra point.
      tasks_content2: >-
        Do not let the task intimidate you. If you think it is too hard,
        map something else — for example, a building. The goal is to map every day,
        not complete all the tasks.
      stars: Stars
      stars_content: >-
        With points, you also may gain levels. You start at level 1: the number
        of stars is the level you are at. In a few days you will move to level 2.
        New levels open more tasks. Here are the point thresholds for gaining levels
      stars_level2: level 2 (roughly five consecutive days)
      stars_level3: level 3 (three weeks)
      stars_level4: level 4 (three months)
      stars_level5: level 5 (roughly a year)
      stars_fame: >-
        Mappers who get to the last level enter the hall of fame. They can continue
        their mapping streak after that, of course. For each changeset at that moment
        they will be getting 16 points.
      leaderboard: Leaderboard
      leaderboard_content: >-
        There is no leaderboard. You won't know who's ahead of you and who's behind.
        This is a challenge, not a competition.
